Port of the Objective Caml code supporting John Harrison's logic [textbook](http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521899574) Handbook of Practical Logic and Automated Reasoning to Scala.

We kept the file names of the original mostly intact, though use Scala naming conventions.

This project is part of [EDLA](http://www.edla.org).
